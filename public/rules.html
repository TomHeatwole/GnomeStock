        <h1> Rules </h1><br>
        <p> 1. Prices will update at the end of every month and trading will be open for the first few days of every month. </p>
        <p> 2. Weekly self-evaluations will be submitted every sunday with a 0-100 score.</p>
        <p> 3. Monthly evaluations wil be submitted at the end of every month with a 0-100 self-evaluation and a 0-10 evaluation for each other gnome.</p>
        <p> 4. Your total monthly rating (R) is calculated with this formula:<br>
        R = 0.5 * (self monthly rating) + 0.15 * (average of self weekly ratings for that month) + 0.35 * (10 * (average of peer evaluations))</p>
        <p> 5. Your new price will be calculated with this formula:<br>
        Price (Rounded to nearest cent) = 2 ^ (R / 25) </p>
        <p> 6. Everyone will start with $100.00 of buying power and zero stocks.</p>
        <p> 7. Everyone is limited to only owning 2 shares of their own stock at one time. </p>
        <p> 8. Your total portfolio value is simply calculated with this:<br>
        Total value = Buying power + ($MAC price) * (# of shares of $MAC) + ($JACK price) * (# of shares of $JACK) + ... etc.</p>
        <p> 9. If more than $10 are left uninvested during a trading period, there will be a 4% tax on the remaining money over $10</p>
